            <h2 class="cremation-header2">Funeral Service Types</h2>
            <p>A funeral service, whether traditional or more modern, has two functions: to acknowledge the life and death of an individual and to bring the bereaved together in support of one another. The following list includes various types of services that our team can assist in planning for your loved one's funeral.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="service-highlight">Visitation</p>
            <p>This is often called a viewing or a wake. Guests come to pay their respects to the deceased by viewing their casketed body and spending time with the grieving family. A visitation can occur at any time before the funeral service.</p>
            <p class="service-highlight">Funeral Service</p>
            <p>This event commonly takes place at the funeral home, a church, or at the graveside. It can include music, the reading of literary or religious passages, a eulogy, prayer, or the singing of hymns.</p>
            <p class="service-highlight">Committal Service</p>
            <p>If the family plans to bury the deceased, this stage involves the lowering of the casket into the grave, typically accompanied by spoken words or prayer.</p>
            <p class="service-highlight">Funeral Reception</p>
            <p>This post-service gathering or repast is considered a time to share memories, laughter, and support with family and friends.</p>
