                    A funeral ceremony is intended to provide mourners with a collective grieving experience and the chance to celebrate a life lived. While these services can be 
                    considered a rite of passage for the deceased, they can also be the start of a period of mourning for bereaved family members after a loss.
                    
                    Coping after profound changes, like the death of a loved one, can be extremely difficult. Because of that, it becomes easier to understand the true importance 
                    of ceremonially acknowledging death and providing a space for friends and family during times of mourning.

A funeral service, whether traditional or more modern, has two functions: to acknowledge the life and death of 
an individual and to bring the bereaved together in support of one another. The following list includes various 
types of services that our team can assist in planning for your loved one's funeral.

                    <span>Visitation</span>
                    This is often called a viewing or a wake. Guests come to pay their respects to the deceased by viewing their casketed 
                    body and spending time with the grieving family. A visitation can occur at any time before the funeral service.
                    
                    <span>Funeral Service</span>
                    This event commonly takes place at the funeral home, a church, or at the graveside. It can include music, the reading
                    of literary or religious passages, a eulogy, prayer, or the singing of hymns.
                    
                    <span>Committal Service</span>
                    If the family plans to bury the deceased, this stage involves the lowering of the casket into the grave, typically 
                    accompanied by spoken words or prayer.

                    <span>Funeral Reception</span>
                    This post-service gathering or repast is considered a time to share memories, laughter, and support with family 
                    and friends.

                    We offer a number of affordable service options if you are choosing burial for your loved one. Each can be tailored to
                    meet the needs and expectations of today's price-conscious families. Our knowledgeable staff is here to help if you 
                    have any questions about our offerings.

                        <br>crypt. If that is the case, be sure to obtain the
