                    Part of making funeral arrangements on behalf of a loved one involves choosing between burial and cremation. This is a big decision based on any number of 
                    factors, including religious or spiritual beliefs, finances, and ecological awareness.
                    
                    It's important to remember that choosing cremation is only one part of providing meaningful end-of-life care. Bringing family and friends together provides 
                    everyone with the opportunity to share memories and receive support, and our team can help you plan a fitting memorial service (with or without the 
                    cremation urn present) at our facility or in a place of your choosing.

                    <span class="header-color">Traditional Cremation Services</span>
                    Traditional cremation is much like a traditional funeral. The body of the deceased, placed in a cremation 
                    or a rental casket, is the focal point of the celebration. Visitations can take place prior to funeral 
                    services, and they are all followed by the cremation itself. Once the cremation has occurred, cremated 
                    remains are returned to the family, who can then decide to scatter, bury, or retain the ashes in an urn.
                    
                    <span class="header-color">Memorial Gathering After Cremation</span>
                    A memorial gathering can occur at any time after the cremation process. The urn is usually on display
                     at the service, which can take place in any setting preferred by the family.
                    
                    <span class="header-color">Direct Cremation</span>
                    Direct cremation involves completion of all required paperwork and transportation of the deceased
                    from the hospital, home, nursing facility, or coroner's office directly to the crematory for the cremation
                    process.
