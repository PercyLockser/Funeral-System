            <h2 class="cremation-header2">Cremation Service Types</h2>
            <p>We offer three main cremation options; each can be modified to meet your needs:</p>
            <br>
            <p class="service-highlight">Traditional Cremation Services</p>
            <p>Traditional cremation is much like a traditional funeral. The body of the deceased, placed in a cremation 
                or a rental casket, is the focal point of the celebration. Visitations can take place prior to funeral 
                services, and they are all followed by the cremation itself. Once the cremation has occurred, cremated 
                remains are returned to the family, who can then decide to scatter, bury, or retain the ashes in an urn.</p>
            
            <p class="service-highlight">Memorial Gathering After Cremation</p>
            <p>A memorial gathering can occur at any time after the cremation process. The urn is usually on display
                at the service, which can take place in any setting preferred by the family.</p>
            
            <p class="service-highlight">Direct Cremation</p>
            <p>Direct cremation involves completion of all required paperwork and transportation of the deceased
                from the hospital, home, nursing facility, or coroner's office directly to the crematory for the cremation
                process.</p>
            <p class="service-highlight">Funeral Reception</p>
            <p>This post-service gathering or repast is considered a time to share memories, laughter, and support with family and friends.</p>
